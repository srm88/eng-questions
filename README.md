Questions to ask an engineering organization!

* How big is the engineering team? How many of those are backend or platform?

* Walk me through the lifecycle of a code change
  * How many people review a change?
  * How large are reviews?
  * How much iteration do reviews go through?
  * Do you review small changes?
  * Do junior devs review patches by seniors?

* Walk me through a deployment

* Tell me about the outage post-mortem process

* Walk me through the process of spinning up a new service.
  * Is there an architecture or design review process?
  * How do you requisition hardware, cloud or otherwise?
  * What's your approach to service discovery?
  * Monitoring and telemetry?
  * Suppose we need a DB or Kafka. Walk me through that process. Who would I talk to? Is it self-serve? Who is responsible for capacity planning? How does the rollout of that service work -- does the storage team help at all? How do you manage event/table schemas?

* Tell me about the kind of code platform engineers write

* Tell me about how platform communicates with other engineers

* Do you have tech talks?

* Tell me how your company might go about changing RPC frameworks. What team or teams might own such a project? Would other teams or developers be involved? How would such a project be communicated? How do you think it would be rolled out?

* Can you tell me about a time a tech debt-introducing change was caught and preempted? How was the change discovered and stopped?

* What’s the single biggest issue or problem facing the team/department/company? What’s currently being done to address it? (from https://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/30/questions-im-asking-in-interviews/)
